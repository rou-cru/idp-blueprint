# Contribution Guidelines

The canonical, up‑to‑date contribution guide lives in the documentation site
under `Contribute → Contributing Guide` and in the `Docs/guides` directory of
this repository.

Please read:

- `Docs/guides/contributing.md` – full contribution guidelines, development
  environment, checks, and conventions
- `Docs/reference/labels-standard.md` – canonical label, PriorityClass, and
  sync‑wave standards

For a quick start on running the platform locally, see the **Quick Start**
section in the root `README.md`.
