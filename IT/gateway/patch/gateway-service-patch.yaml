# gateway-service-patch.yaml
#
# Forces the Cilium LoadBalancer Service to use static NodePorts for HTTP and HTTPS.
# This is necessary because in the k3d environment, we need to map host ports
# to specific ports on the master node. By setting these NodePorts statically,
# we ensure that the gateway is always accessible from the host machine via
# ports 80 and 443, which are mapped in the k3d-cluster.yaml configuration.
#
# The patch targets the service created by the Cilium Gateway API for our specific
# Gateway resource ('idp-gateway').
