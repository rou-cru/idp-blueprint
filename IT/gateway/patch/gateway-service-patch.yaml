# gateway-service-patch.yaml
#
# Forces the Cilium Gateway Service to use static NodePorts for HTTP and HTTPS.
# This is necessary because in the k3d environment, we need to map host ports
# to specific ports on the master node.
#
# The patch targets the service created by the Cilium Gateway API for our specific
# Gateway resource ('idp-gateway').
#
# IMPORTANT: Cilium auto-generates port names as "port-{number}" (e.g., port-80, port-443)
# not the listener names from the Gateway spec (http, https).
