Governance in a platform is often seen as a blocker—a gate that slows down development. In this IDP, we invert that model. We treat **Policy as Code** as an enabler, using it to define the "rules of the road" so that developers can move fast without breaking things.

Instead of manual reviews or PDF guidelines, we use **Kyverno** to enforce best practices, security standards, and operational hygiene automatically at the Kubernetes API level.

## The Governance Layer

The governance engine is deployed early in the bootstrap process, ensuring that the cluster is secure by default before any application workloads arrive. This creates a safe environment where compliance is continuous, not an afterthought.

We organize policies into three logical layers, each serving a distinct purpose in the platform's stability.

### Baseline Standards
This layer enforces the non-negotiable structural requirements of the platform. It ensures that every namespace has the correct labels for cost allocation, that resource quotas are applied to prevent "noisy neighbor" problems, and that standard annotations are present for tools like the backup system or the developer portal.

### Security Safeguards
The security layer acts as the immune system of the cluster. It actively blocks unsafe configurations, such as containers requesting privileged access (`root`), mounting sensitive host paths, or pulling images from unverified public registries. By enforcing these rules at admission time, we prevent vulnerabilities from ever running.

### Platform Hygiene
This layer maintains the operational health of the fleet. It validates that workloads define proper requests and limits for the scheduler, that they use valid PriorityClasses, and that they don't abuse ServiceAccounts. This keeps the cluster efficient and predictable.

## Visibility and Reporting

Enforcement is only half the battle; visibility is the other. Blocking a deployment without explanation frustrates developers.

We solve this with **Policy Reporter**, a tool that aggregates policy violations and presents them in a unified dashboard. It turns "compliance" from a black box into a transparent metric. Developers can see exactly why a workload is non-compliant, while platform engineers can track the overall health score of the cluster over time.

This visibility extends to the observability stack. Policy violations are exported as Prometheus metrics, allowing us to correlate a drop in compliance score with a new deployment or a spike in security alerts, closing the feedback loop.
