The eventing stack provides event-driven automation and orchestration capabilities for the platform, enabling reactive workflows and intelligent system responses.

## Overview

Event-driven architecture decouples producers from consumers, allowing the platform to react dynamically to changes in Kubernetes, Git repositories, external systems, and monitoring alerts. This enables automation patterns like:

- Triggering CI/CD workflows on Git push events
- Executing remediation workflows when SLO burn rates exceed thresholds
- Orchestrating multi-step processes across platform components
- Scheduling periodic maintenance tasks
- Auto-scaling based on custom business metrics

The eventing stack is deployed from `K8s/events/*` and synchronized through `task stacks:events`, ensuring consistent event infrastructure across all environments.

## Core Components

- **[Argo Events](argo-events.mdx)**: Event-driven dependency manager. Automation for Kubernetes

## Key Capabilities

The eventing stack provides:

- **Event Ingestion**: Multiple event source types (webhooks, Kubernetes resources, message queues, cloud events)
- **Event Routing**: Reliable message bus with at-least-once delivery semantics
- **Event Processing**: Filter, transform, and aggregate events before triggering actions
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Trigger Argo Workflows based on event patterns
- **GitOps Integration**: Invoke ArgoCD syncs intelligently based on repository events
- **Fan-Out Patterns**: Single event triggers multiple parallel actions

## Common Use Cases

### Continuous Deployment

Automatically build, test, and deploy applications when code is pushed to Git repositories.

### Incident Response

Trigger remediation workflows when monitoring alerts fire, reducing mean time to recovery (MTTR).

### Scheduled Automation

Execute periodic tasks like backups, cleanup jobs, and compliance scans using calendar-based triggers.

### Cross-Service Orchestration

Coordinate complex workflows across multiple platform components with event-driven coordination.

## Deployment Structure

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `K8s/events/governance/` | Namespace, quotas, and resource limits for the eventing stack |
| `K8s/events/argo-events/` | Argo Events controller, webhook, and EventBus configuration |
| `K8s/events/applicationset-events.yaml` | ApplicationSet for GitOps-based event infrastructure deployment |

## Integration Points

The eventing stack integrates with:

- **Argo Workflows**: Primary execution engine for event-triggered workflows
- **ArgoCD**: Intelligent application syncs triggered by repository events
- **Prometheus/Alertmanager**: Alert-driven automation and remediation
- **Git Providers**: Webhook-based CI/CD pipeline triggers
- **External Systems**: Custom HTTP endpoints and message queues

## Getting Started

See the [Argo Events documentation](argo-events.mdx) for detailed configuration, event source patterns, sensor recipes, and operational guidance.
