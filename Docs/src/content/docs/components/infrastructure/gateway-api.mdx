Gateway API provides a standard way to expose services with TLS and routing.

## Why Gateway API?

Gateway API is the successor to Ingress. It splits configuration into two resources:

- **Gateway**: Infrastructure concerns managed by platform engineers (listeners, TLS
  certificates, load balancer settings)
- **HTTPRoute**: Application routing managed by developers (path matching, backends,
  traffic splitting)

This separation enables better collaboration. Platform teams configure Gateways once,
application teams create HTTPRoutes that attach to them without coordinating on shared
resources.

Gateway API also supports features like request header modification, traffic weighting,
and cross-namespace routing with RBAC controls. These required vendor-specific annotations
in Ingress or weren't possible at all.

Cilium implements Gateway API natively, and major service meshes (Istio, Linkerd) are
adopting it.

## Architecture Role

Gateway API operates at **Layer 1** of the platform, the Platform Services layer. Cilium
implements the Gateway API, so this is conceptual rather than a separately deployed service.

Key integration points:

- **Cilium**: Provides the Gateway API implementation
- **Cert-Manager**: Supplies the wildcard TLS certificate used by the Gateway
- **HTTPRoutes**: Applications define routing rules that attach to the Gateway
- **DNS (nip.io)**: Wildcard DNS for local development (e.g., `*.127.0.0.1.nip.io`)

The platform uses a single Gateway with a wildcard certificate. Services define HTTPRoutes
that specify hostnames and path matching.

See [Networking & Gateway](../../concepts/networking-gateway.md) for detailed configuration
patterns.
