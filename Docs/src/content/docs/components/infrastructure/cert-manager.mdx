## Why Cert-Manager?

Cert-Manager automates TLS certificate issuance and renewal. The alternative is manual certificate generation, distribution, tracking expiration dates, and renewal.

It supports multiple certificate authorities (Let's Encrypt, Venafi, self-signed, enterprise CAs) and challenge types (HTTP-01, DNS-01, TLS-ALPN-01). For this platform, it bootstraps a self-signed CA and uses it to issue certificates for internal services.

Certificates auto-renew before expiration. Services reference certificates via Kubernetes Secrets, which Cert-Manager updates. When mTLS is added in the future, Cert-Manager can issue per-pod certificates and rotate them automatically.

Cert-Manager doesn't depend on provider-specific certificate services, keeping the platform portable.

## Architecture Role

Cert-Manager operates at **Layer 1** of the platform, the Platform Services layer. It's a cross-cutting service that provides PKI for any component that needs TLS.

Key integration points:

- **ClusterIssuers**: Define certificate authorities (self-signed, CA-based, ACME)
- **Certificates**: Declarative resources that request certificates from issuers
- **Kubernetes Secrets**: Cert-Manager stores certificates here, making them consumable by any workload
- **Gateway API**: Uses the `idp-wildcard-cert` certificate for TLS termination

The PKI bootstrap process is fully declarative:

1. Self-signed ClusterIssuer creates a root CA certificate
2. That CA certificate backs a CA ClusterIssuer
3. The CA ClusterIssuer issues certificates for applications

This pattern creates a complete, self-contained PKI without external dependencies.

See [Secrets management architecture](../../architecture/secrets.md) for the PKI flow diagram and deeper context.
