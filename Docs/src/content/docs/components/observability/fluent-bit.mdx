## Why Fluent-bit?

Fluent-bit is designed for performance and low resource consumption. It runs as a DaemonSet on every node, capturing container logs and forwarding them to Loki.

The alternative is Fluentd, which is more feature-rich but heavier. In resource-constrained edge environments, Fluent-bit's lightweight footprint makes it the better choice. It's flexible enough for complex log processing if needed, and works in diverse environments (even AWS Fargate).

Fluent-bit handles the push model for logs: it actively forwards logs to Loki as they're generated, ensuring logs are captured even if a pod crashes immediately.

## Architecture Role

Fluent-bit operates at **Layer 1** of the platform, the Platform Services layer. It's part of the log collection pipeline.

Key integration points:

- **Kubernetes**: Runs as a DaemonSet, collects logs from all containers on each node
- **Loki**: Forwards logs to Loki's API
- **Node filesystem**: Reads container logs from `/var/log/containers`

The configuration tails container logs, parses JSON-formatted logs, and forwards them to Loki with appropriate labels.

See [Observability Model](../../../architecture/observability.md) for the complete log pipeline.
