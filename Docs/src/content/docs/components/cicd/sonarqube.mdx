## Why SonarQube?

SonarQube provides static code analysis for quality gates in CI/CD pipelines. It scans code for bugs, code smells, security vulnerabilities, and technical debt, then reports on code quality metrics.

While there are lighter, more cloud-native alternatives, SonarQube is mature and widely used in enterprise environments. It supports many languages, has extensive rule sets, and provides detailed reports.

In this platform, Argo Workflows can trigger SonarQube scans as part of the CI pipeline. The scan results feed into quality gates that determine whether code can be promoted.

## Architecture Role

SonarQube sits at **Layer 3** of the platform, the Developer-Facing Applications layer. It's a quality analysis tool used during CI.

Key integration points:

- **Argo Workflows**: Workflows trigger SonarQube scans
- **PostgreSQL**: SonarQube's data store (deployed alongside)
- **Gateway API**: Exposed via HTTPRoute for accessing the UI
- **Git Provider**: Can comment on pull requests with scan results

SonarQube runs as a stateful service with persistent storage for scan history and configuration.
