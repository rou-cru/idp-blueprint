This section documents the **demo implementation** of IDP Blueprint. It explains how
the reference architecture is realized in a runnable environment, which concrete
decisions make the demo deployable on constrained hardware, and where those decisions
live in the repository.

You will not find step‑by‑step setup here; that lives under Getting Started. These
pages show the real wiring behind the demo: how GitOps is layered, how traffic enters
and reaches services, how workloads are prioritized, how security boundaries are
applied, and how signals are captured and routed. Each page answers three questions:
what the implementation does, why it is designed that way, and which tradeoffs are
specific to the demo.

## Scope of the demo implementation

The demo is intentionally opinionated. It prioritizes reproducibility and a small
operational footprint over production hardening, so you can run it end‑to‑end and
inspect the moving parts without external dependencies.

## How to read the Implementation section

Start here for the systems view, then drill into the individual areas:

- [GitOps model](gitops-model) — how bootstrap and continuous reconciliation are wired.
- [Networking & gateway](networking-gateway) — how traffic reaches services.
- [Scheduling & node pools](scheduling-nodepools) — capacity, priorities, and pools.
- [Security & policy model](security-policy-model) — security boundaries in practice.
- [Observability](../architecture/observability) — signal flows and alerting design.

Read this section after you have deployed the platform once and skimmed
[Architecture overview](../architecture/overview). From there, Implementation provides
the practical context to extend or modify the demo safely.
