Comprehensive security scanner for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations

## Component Information

## Why Trivy?

Trivy scans container images for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and secrets. It's
comprehensive, fast, and can run in CI pipelines or as an operator in-cluster.

Trivy supports multiple scan targets (container images, filesystems, Git repositories,
Kubernetes resources) and outputs results in various formats. It integrates with CI/CD
workflows to block deployments of vulnerable images.

In this platform, Trivy can scan images during the build phase (in Argo Workflows) and
periodically scan running workloads for newly discovered vulnerabilities.

## Architecture Role

Trivy operates at **Layer 3** of the platform, part of the security tooling.

Key integration points:

- **Argo Workflows**: Workflows can trigger Trivy scans as part of CI
- **Container Registry**: Scans images from the registry
- **Kubernetes API**: Can scan deployed resources for misconfigurations
- **PolicyReports**: Can generate PolicyReport CRDs for tracking scan results

Trivy runs as an operator that periodically scans resources and reports findings.
