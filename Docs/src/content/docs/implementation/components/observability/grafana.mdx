The leading platform for analytics and monitoring

## Why Grafana?

Grafana provides a unified interface for querying metrics and logs. The kube-prometheus-stack
chart bundles it with Prometheus and includes dashboards for Kubernetes components.

Grafana supports multiple data sources. In this platform:

- **Prometheus**: For metrics (resource usage, application performance, SLO burn rates)
- **Loki**: For logs (structured log queries, correlation with metrics)

The ability to correlate metrics and logs in the same interface helps with debugging. You can
see a spike in errors in a Prometheus graph, then query Loki for the corresponding error logs.

Grafana dashboards can be stored as ConfigMaps, making observability infrastructure
reproducible and versionable in Git.

## Architecture Role

Grafana sits at **Layer 3** of the platform, the Developer-Facing Applications layer. It's a
user interface that consumes data from services below.

Key integration points:

- **Prometheus**: Configured as a data source for metrics
- **Loki**: Configured as a data source for logs
- **Vault → External Secrets**: Admin credentials synced
- **Gateway API**: Exposed via HTTPRoute for browser access
- **ConfigMaps**: Dashboards stored as code

The configuration uses Unified Alerting (Grafana's built-in alerting) as the primary alerting
interface.

See [Observability Model](../../../architecture/observability) for the complete observability
architecture.

## Configuration Values

Grafana is bundled inside the kube-prometheus-stack deployment. Its values are managed in that
chart; see the Prometheus component page for the generated values table.
