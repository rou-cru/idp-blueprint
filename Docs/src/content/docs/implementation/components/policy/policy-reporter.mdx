Monitoring and observability for policy engine results

| **Chart Version** | `3.5.0` |
| **Chart Type** | `application` |

## Why Policy Reporter?

Policy Reporter aggregates PolicyReport CRDs generated by Kyverno and presents them in a
dashboard. It provides visibility into policy compliance across the cluster.

Without Policy Reporter, you'd need to query PolicyReport resources directly using kubectl
or write custom tooling. Policy Reporter provides a web UI, exports metrics to Prometheus,
and can send notifications when violations occur.

It's specifically designed to work with Kyverno's PolicyReport outputs, making it a natural
fit for this platform.

## Architecture Role

Policy Reporter sits at **Layer 3** of the platform, the Developer-Facing Applications layer.
It's a visualization tool for policy compliance.

Key integration points:

- **Kyverno**: Consumes PolicyReport CRDs generated by Kyverno
- **Prometheus**: Exposes policy compliance metrics
- **Gateway API**: Exposed via HTTPRoute for accessing the dashboard

Policy Reporter watches for PolicyReport resources and updates its internal state. The
dashboard shows current compliance status and historical trends.
