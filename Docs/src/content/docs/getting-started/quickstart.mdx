Run the demo so you can observe the reference architecture in motion. This assumes you already met the prerequisites (container runtime + git; tooling via Devbox or Dev Container). Expect a few minutes for images to download and for ArgoCD to reconcile everything.

## Optional: trim the demo

Edit `config.toml` `[fuses]` to disable stacks you do not need (`observability`, `cicd`, `security`, `events`, `backstage`). The `prod` flag hardens ArgoCD defaults. These toggles change what the demo deploys; they do not change the architecture model. Make changes before running `task deploy`.

Never keep real passwords or secrets in plain text. The demo ships simple values for convenience—replace them with your own secure secrets for anything beyond local exploration.

## Deploy

```bash
task deploy
```

Run it from the repository root. It spins up a three-node k3d cluster, sets up networking (Cilium, Gateway API), cert-manager,
Vault + External Secrets, ArgoCD, and then lets ApplicationSets bring up the stacks you left enabled.

Typical runs take about 5–15 minutes depending on bandwidth and available resources.

### What to expect while it runs

Early logs cover k3d creation and Cilium; later you will see ArgoCD, Gateway NodePorts, and ApplicationSets per stack.

ArgoCD keeps reconciling after `task deploy` exits, so Healthy/Synced states appear gradually as images finish pulling.
The task prints nip.io URLs (based on your LAN IP) when the Gateway is ready.

You can open `k9s` to watch resources settle.

Do not worry if things take a few minutes or some workloads show transient issues. Multiple Helm charts reconcile in parallel under GitOps; the cluster converges as images finish pulling. On most setups it settles in ~5 minutes; slower networks may take closer to 10–15.

## Clean up

```bash
task destroy
```

Running `task destroy` deletes the k3d cluster and all demo resources, returning your host to the state before deployment. Use it when you finish exploring or need to reclaim disk space.
