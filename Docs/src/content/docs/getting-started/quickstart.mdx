Run the demo so you can observe the reference architecture in motion. This assumes you already met the prerequisites (container runtime + git; tooling via Devbox or Dev Container). Expect a few minutes for images to download and for ArgoCD to reconcile everything.

## Enter the toolchain

Open the project in VS Code and choose “Reopen in Container”, or start a Devbox shell with `devbox shell`. Both options supply `task`, `k3d`, `kubectl`, `helm`, `k9s`, and `argocd` for the session. Stay in the project root while you work so the Taskfile targets resolve correctly.

## Optional: trim the demo

Edit `config.toml` `[fuses]` to disable stacks you do not need (`observability`, `cicd`, `security`, `events`, `backstage`). The `prod` flag hardens ArgoCD defaults. These toggles change what the demo deploys; they do not change the architecture model. Make changes before running `task deploy`.

**Never save your real passwords in plain text!** this was made in pourpuse to simplify the process to you
but **IS NOT a good idea**, dont underestimate the risk about this. the use of this metod is just for demo, not real use.

## Deploy

```bash
task deploy
```

Run it from the repository root. It spins up a three-node k3d cluster, sets up networking (Cilium, Gateway API), cert-manager, Vault + External Secrets, ArgoCD, and then lets ApplicationSets bring up the stacks you left enabled. Typical laptops take ~5–10 minutes. If you see port conflicts or insufficient resources, stop here and resolve them before retrying.

:::tip
Use `task --summary deploy` or `task --verbose deploy` if you want to watch each step.
:::

### What to expect while it runs

Early logs cover k3d creation and Cilium; later you will see ArgoCD, Gateway NodePorts, and ApplicationSets per stack. ArgoCD keeps reconciling after `task deploy` exits, so Healthy/Synced states appear gradually as images finish pulling. The task prints nip.io URLs (based on your LAN IP) when the Gateway is ready—save them for Verify.

## First access

When the Gateway is ready, open the printed URLs (e.g., `https://argocd.<ip>.nip.io`). They are reachable from your LAN.

:::caution
Gateway NodePorts come from `config.toml` (default 30080/30443). Keep those ports free and allow inbound traffic if you want LAN access.
:::

You can also open `k9s` to watch resources settle.

### Credentials

ArgoCD admin user: `admin`. The password comes from `config.toml` (`passwords.argocd_admin`, default `argo`) and is stored bcrypt in the ArgoCD Secret. Vault is initialized and unsealed for the demo; secrets fan out via External Secrets. Treat this material as local-only and replace it for anything beyond the demo.

See [Verify Installation](verify) for expected signals and smoke checks.

## Clean up

```bash
task destroy
```

Running `task destroy` deletes the k3d cluster and all demo resources, returning your host to the state before deployment. Use it when you finish exploring or need to reclaim disk space.
