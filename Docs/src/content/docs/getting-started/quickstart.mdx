Spin up the full IDP locally with one command, then watch it settle while images pull and
ArgoCD syncs. Expect a few minutes of eventual consistency.

## Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rou-cru/idp-blueprint
cd idp-blueprint
```

:::tip
Open the repo in VS Code and “Reopen in Container”, or run with Devbox to get the tooling
preinstalled.
:::

## Deploy

```bash
task deploy
```

That single command creates the `idp-demo` k3d cluster, bootstraps Cilium, cert-manager,
Vault, External Secrets, ArgoCD, and the Gateway, then lets ApplicationSets light up
observability, CI/CD, security, events, and backstage—each gated by the fuses described in
[Architecture overview](../architecture/overview#feature-toggles-fuses). On typical laptop
hardware it takes about 5–10 minutes.

### What happens during deploy (quick tour)

The run creates the cluster and namespaces, installs networking CRDs and Cilium, brings in
cert-manager plus Vault and External Secrets, then starts ArgoCD and exposes services
through the Gateway with TLS. ApplicationSets generate ArgoCD Applications for each stack
under `K8s/`, ordered with sync waves, and gated by your fuses in `config.toml`.

:::tip
ArgoCD keeps syncing after the task completes; Applications turn Healthy/Synced gradually
as images download and pods become Ready. The task prints the service URLs when Gateway is
ready (for example `https://argocd.<ip>.nip.io`)—copy them from the output.
:::

## First access

When the Gateway is ready, open the URLs the task prints. They use a nip.io wildcard based
on your LAN IP (for example `https://argocd.192-168-1-20.nip.io`) and are reachable from
the LAN.

:::caution
Gateway NodePorts come from `config.toml`. Keep those ports free and open in your OS
firewall so LAN browsers can reach the services.
:::

You can also open `k9s` to inspect the cluster state from the terminal.

### Credentials

Vault is initialized, unsealed, and seeds secrets automatically during deploy, and
External Secrets fans them out to workloads. Default values come from `config.toml`; the
root token lives in a Kubernetes Secret.

:::danger
Local-only root/unseal material is managed by helper scripts for demo purposes—swap this
for real secret management in production.

## Clean up

Tear everything down when you’re done:

```bash
task destroy
```
