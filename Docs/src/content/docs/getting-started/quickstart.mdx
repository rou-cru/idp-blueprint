Spin up the full IDP locally with one command, then validate access and credentials. Expect eventual consistency for a few minutes while images download.

## Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rou-cru/idp-blueprint
cd idp-blueprint
```

Optional: open in VS Code and “Reopen in Container”, or run with Devbox.

## Deploy

```bash
task deploy
```

- Creates k3d cluster `idp-demo`
- Bootstraps core: Cilium, cert-manager, Vault, External Secrets, ArgoCD, Gateway
- Deploys Kyverno/Policy Reporter, then ApplicationSets for observability, CI/CD, security, events, and backstage (gated by [fuses](../architecture/overview.md#feature-toggles-fuses) except events)

Time: ~5–10 minutes depending on network and hardware.

:::tip[Deploy behavior]

- ArgoCD will keep syncing after the task completes. It’s normal for Applications to become Healthy/Synced gradually as images download and pods become Ready.
- The task prints the service URLs when Gateway is ready (for example `https://argocd.<ip>.nip.io`). Copy them from the output.

:::

## First access

When the Gateway is ready, open the printed URLs for exposed services. They use a nip.io wildcard derived from your LAN IP (for example `https://argocd.192-168-1-20.nip.io`) and are exposed to LAN network..

:::caution
Gateway NodePorts come from `config.toml`. Make sure those ports are free and allowed in your OS firewall so LAN browsers can reach the services.
:::

Also you could use `k9s` to inspect the cluster state visually in CLI.

### Credentials

Vault is initialized, unsealed and creates secret values automatically during deploy. Then External Secrets propagate them to workloads than need it.

Default values to the secrets created are from `config.toml` and the root token is hold in a secret.

:::danger
Local-only root/unseal material is managed by helper scripts. However thats just a workaround to demo purpouse, dont do this on production and instead replace the file for secure methods
:::

See [Verify Installation](verify.md) for details about expected results.

## 4. Clean up

Tear everything down when you’re done:

```bash
task destroy
```
