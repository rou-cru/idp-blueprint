Spin up the full IDP locally with one command, then validate access and credentials. Expect eventual consistency for a few minutes while images download.

## 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rou-cru/idp-blueprint
cd idp-blueprint
```

Optional: open in VS Code and “Reopen in Container”, or run with Devbox.

:::note
Run `docker login` before deploying to avoid Docker Hub rate limiting during image pulls.
:::

## 2. Deploy

```bash
task deploy
```

- Creates k3d cluster `idp-demo`
- Bootstraps Cilium, cert-manager, Vault, External Secrets, ArgoCD, Gateway
- Brings up Kyverno + Policy Reporter first (standalone ArgoCD Application), then
  ArgoCD ApplicationSets for the stacks: observability, CI/CD, security, events,
  and backstage (stack fuses gate everything except events). ApplicationSets
  expand folders under `K8s/` into many ArgoCD Applications (see
  [`GitOps, Policy, and Eventing`](../concepts/gitops-model.md))

Time: ~5–10 minutes depending on network and hardware.

:::tip[Deploy behavior]
- ArgoCD will keep syncing after the task completes. It’s normal for Applications to become Healthy/Synced gradually as images download and pods become Ready.
- The task prints the service URLs when Gateway is ready (for example `https://argocd.<ip>.nip.io`). Copy them from the output.
:::

:::caution
The Gateway uses NodePorts from `config.toml` (`nodeport_http`/`nodeport_https`, defaults `30080`/`30443`).
Ensure they are not in use by other services.
:::

## 3. First access

When the Gateway is ready, open the printed URLs. They use a nip.io wildcard derived from your LAN IP (for example `https://argocd.192-168-1-20.nip.io`). Ensure the configured NodePorts are allowed by your OS firewall.

**We highly recommend using `k9s` to inspect the cluster state visually.**

### Credentials

ArgoCD admin password comes from Vault via External Secrets.
By default it’s configured in `config.toml`:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: value of `passwords.argocd_admin` (default: `argo`)

Retrieve it from Kubernetes if you changed defaults:

```bash
kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-secret -o jsonpath='{.data.admin\.password}' | base64 -d; echo
```

Vault is initialized automatically during deploy.
Local-only root/unseal material is managed by `task vault:init` and helper scripts.

:::note
Prefer managing configuration via `config.toml`. Direct environment
overrides are supported by tasks for testing, but the TOML file is the
canonical source.

See [Verify Installation](verify.md) for expected results and smoke tests.

## 4. Clean up

Tear everything down when you’re done:

```bash
task destroy
```
