IDP Blueprint is an **open-source reference architecture for Internal Developer
Platforms** on Kubernetes. It defines patterns for GitOps-driven infrastructure, policy
enforcement, secrets management, observability, and developer tooling—designed with
production concerns (scalability, security, maintainability) as primary constraints.

The project **includes a demo implementation** optimized to run on laptop-class
hardware, home labs, or single-node development clusters. The demo validates the
architecture in a live environment, allowing you to explore component interactions and
operational workflows rather than relying solely on documentation.

**Architecture vs Implementation:** The reference architecture establishes
technology-agnostic patterns applicable to production environments. The demo makes
deliberate tradeoffs—simplified secret management, ephemeral DNS (nip.io), reduced
resource reservations—to remain deployable on constrained hardware. Before production
use, these demo-specific choices must be replaced with hardened alternatives matching
your operational context.

## What the demo provides

The reference implementation deploys a three-node local Kubernetes cluster with the full
IDP stack. Deployment orchestration is automated through `task deploy`, which handles
dependency sequencing and validation.

The demo environment includes operational tooling (kubectl, k9s, ArgoCD CLI, MCP
integrations) encapsulated in Devbox or VS Code Dev Containers. The host requires only a
container runtime, git, and sufficient hardware resources.

## Demo vs Production

The demo implementation makes deliberate tradeoffs to remain deployable on constrained
hardware. **These are implementation choices for the demo, not architectural decisions
of the IDP reference.**

| Aspect              | Demo Implementation                          | Production Recommendation                                         |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Secrets**         | Credentials in `config.toml` (Git-tracked)   | External secret store (Vault cluster, cloud KMS) + sealed secrets |
| **DNS**             | nip.io wildcard (ephemeral, no registration) | Registered domain + DNS provider integration                      |
| **TLS**             | Self-signed CA, HTTP internal to services    | Valid CA certificates, end-to-end TLS                             |
| **Vault**           | Standalone, auto-unseal via K8s Secret       | HA cluster (Raft/Consul), hardware/cloud auto-unseal              |
| **Networking**      | NodePort (30080/30443) on k3d                | LoadBalancer with cloud integration or MetalLB/Cilium L2          |
| **Resource sizing** | Minimal requests/limits, single replicas     | Sized for load, multi-replica, HPA enabled                        |
| **Retention**       | Short-term (Loki 6h, small PVCs)             | Long-term retention, object storage backends                      |

The underlying architecture—GitOps control plane, policy-driven governance, layered
infrastructure, observability stack—applies to production. See the Architecture section
for design decisions independent of demo-specific implementations.

The following sections guide you through deploying and validating the reference
implementation.
