Welcome. In this section you will deploy the platform locally, check that it is healthy, and understand at a high level what you just created.

If you want the full architectural view, see [Architecture overview](../architecture/overview.md). Here we focus on what you need to know to run the commands with confidence.

## What you will build

After completing the quickstart you will have:

- A local k3d Kubernetes cluster (by default `idp-demo`).
- Core platform services:
  - Cilium, Gateway API.
  - Vault, External Secrets Operator, cert‑manager.
  - Prometheus, Loki, Grafana.
- GitOps and policy control planes:
  - ArgoCD with ApplicationSets (a controller that generates many Applications
    from the `K8s/` folder structure; see
    [`GitOps, Policy, and Eventing`](../concepts/gitops-model.md)).
  - Kyverno and Policy Reporter.
- Stacks for:
  - Observability.
  - CI/CD.
  - Security scanning.

All of this is deployed from this repository using `task deploy`.
