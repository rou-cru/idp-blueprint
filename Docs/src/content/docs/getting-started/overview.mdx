Welcome. In this section you will deploy the platform locally, check that it is healthy, and
understand at a high level what you just created.

If you want the full architectural view, see [Architecture overview](../architecture/overview).
Here we focus on what you need to know to run the commands with confidence.

## What you will build

By the end of the quickstart you will be looking at a running k3d cluster named `idp-demo`
with Cilium and the Gateway API wiring traffic, Vault seeded and bridged to External
Secrets and cert‑manager, Prometheus/Loki/Grafana watching over the cluster, and ArgoCD
driving GitOps together with Kyverno and Policy Reporter. ApplicationSets fan out the
stacks in `K8s/` so observability, CI/CD, security scanning, events, and Backstage come up
without extra flags. The whole story begins and ends with a single command: `task deploy`.

## Feature Toggles

Use the `[fuses]` section in `config.toml` to turn stacks on or off. The keys
`policies`, `security`, `observability`, `cicd`, and `backstage` each gate a stack; `prod`
hardens ArgoCD. Everything ships enabled except `prod`.

## What `task deploy` does

With the default `config.toml`, `task deploy` spins up a three-node k3d cluster, layers in
networking, certificates, Vault + External Secrets, and then brings up ArgoCD and the
Gateway. It prints nip.io URLs from your LAN IP and lets ArgoCD reconcile the stacks you
left enabled.

Typical log snippets:

```text
task: [k3d:k3d:create] ... k3d cluster create idp-demo ...
task: [bootstrap:cilium:deploy] helm upgrade --install cilium ...
task: [bootstrap:vault:init] Vault initialized successfully
task: [bootstrap:argocd:deploy] helm upgrade --install argocd ...
task: [bootstrap:gateway:deploy] NodePorts verified: HTTP=30080, HTTPS=30443
task: [stacks:observability] applicationset-observability created
task: [stacks:cicd] applicationset-cicd created
task: [stacks:security] applicationset-security created
task: [stacks:backstage] applicationset-backstage created
task: [stacks:events] applicationset-events created
Deployment complete
```

:::tip
Run `task --summary deploy` or `task --verbose deploy` to see each command as it runs.
