Welcome. In this section you will deploy the platform locally, check that it is healthy, and
understand at a high level what you just created.

If you want the full architectural view, see [Architecture overview](../architecture/overview.md).
Here we focus on what you need to know to run the commands with confidence.

## What you will build

After completing the quickstart you will have:

- A local k3d Kubernetes cluster (by default `idp-demo`).
- Core platform services:
  - Cilium, Gateway API.
  - Vault, External Secrets Operator, cert‑manager.
  - Prometheus, Loki, Grafana.
- GitOps and policy control planes:
  - ArgoCD with ApplicationSets (a controller that generates many Applications
    from the `K8s/` folder structure; see
    [`GitOps, Policy, and Eventing`](../concepts/gitops-model.md)).
  - Kyverno and Policy Reporter.
- Stacks for:
  - Observability.
  - CI/CD.
  - Security scanning.

All of this is deployed from this repository using `task deploy`.

## Feature Toggles (Fuses)

The platform includes feature toggles called "fuses" that allow you to control which components are
deployed. In the `config.toml` file, you'll find a `[fuses]` section where you can enable or
disable different stacks:

- `policies`: Controls deployment of Kyverno policy engine
- `security`: Controls deployment of security stack (Trivy Operator)
- `observability`: Controls deployment of monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki)
- `cicd`: Controls deployment of CI/CD stack (Argo Workflows, SonarQube)
- `backstage`: Controls deployment of Backstage developer portal
- `prod`: Enables production-hardened configurations

By default, all stacks except `prod` are enabled. The events stack (Argo Events) is always deployed
regardless of fuse settings.

## One command: what `task deploy` actually does

With the default `config.toml`, `task deploy` runs this end-to-end sequence. No manual
flags or extra environment variables are needed; the Taskfile orchestrates everything.

1) **Create the base**
   - Checks inotify, creates a 3-node k3d cluster plus local registry cache.
   - Applies namespaces and initial PriorityClasses.
2) **Install CRDs and networking**
   - Installs Gateway API and Prometheus Operator CRDs.
   - Deploys Cilium as CNI and waits for pods to be `Ready`.
3) **Certificates and secrets**
   - Installs cert-manager and applies the CA/ClusterIssuers.
   - Installs Vault, initializes it, and configures Kubernetes auth roles for ESO.
   - Seeds initial secrets (ArgoCD, Grafana, SonarQube, Backstage, registry).
   - Installs External Secrets Operator and waits for it to be available.
4) **GitOps and gateway**
   - Installs ArgoCD (standard mode), applies AppProjects per stack.
   - Applies ExternalSecrets for ArgoCD credentials.
   - Deploys Gateway API + wildcard TLS, verifies NodePorts (30080/30443), and
     prints detected nip.io URLs.
5) **Auto-pilot stacks (all enabled by default)**
   - Applies the Kyverno/Policy Reporter Application.
   - Applies ApplicationSets for observability, cicd, security, backstage, and events
     (fuses gate all except events, which is always on).
6) **Complete**
   - Exits with "Deployment complete"; ArgoCD continues reconciling until everything is
     Healthy/Synced.

Real log fragments (high-level summary):

```text
task: [k3d:k3d:create] ... k3d cluster create idp-demo ...
task: [bootstrap:cilium:deploy] helm upgrade --install cilium ...
task: [bootstrap:vault:init] Vault initialized successfully
task: [bootstrap:argocd:deploy] helm upgrade --install argocd ...
task: [bootstrap:gateway:deploy] NodePorts verified: HTTP=30080, HTTPS=30443
task: [stacks:observability] applicationset-observability created

task: [stacks:security] applicationset-security created
task: [stacks:backstage] applicationset-backstage created
task: [stacks:events] applicationset-events created
Deployment complete
```

Tip for debugging timing: re-run with `task --summary deploy` or `task --verbose deploy`
to see every underlying command as it executes.
