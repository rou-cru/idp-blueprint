This is an **open-source reference architecture for an Internal Developer Platform** (IDP) and **includes a demo implementation** that is
optimized to run locally on personal hardware, a home lab, or even a laptop.

The next sections walk you through the demo so **you can explore the architecture in a live environment**, digging into implementation details
instead of only reading high-level architecture descriptions.

This is not a production guide and the demo is not production-ready out of the box. The architecture, however, is **designed with real
production needs in mind**—scalability, maintainability, security, and more—so **it's a starting point to shape your own design**.

The demo uses production-like workflows and wiring between components but favors ease of deployment, so some trade-offs must be addressed
before any real production use. You may also want to customize other aspects to match your environment.


## Deploy the demo

By the end of the quickstart you will have an active local Kubernetes cluster with three nodes, exposed to your LAN.
The experience starts with a single command: `task deploy`, so don't be afraid of dependencies or complex steps.

The demo environment also includes kubectl, k9s, the ArgoCD CLI, and an MCP setup for LLM models. All of that is encapsulated so the host only needs a container runtime, git, and hardware resources. The next section lists the requirements to deploy the demo.
