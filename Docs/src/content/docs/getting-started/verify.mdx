Verify the deployment is converging, identify any resources still settling, and gather the URLs and credentials needed to access platform services.

## First few minutes

ArgoCD keeps syncing after `task deploy` exits. Pods move from Pending to Ready as images download, so Sync/Health will improve gradually rather than instantly.

## Quick checks from the terminal

```bash
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -A | sort
kubectl -n argocd get applications

# Optional: watch live
kubectl get pods -A -w &
kubectl -n argocd get applications -w &

# Gateway readiness (TLS and routes bound)
kubectl -n kube-system wait --for=condition=Programmed gateway/idp-gateway --timeout=300s
```

**Expected signals:**

- Three Ready nodes (named `k3d-idp-demo-*`)
- ArgoCD Applications listed (may require minutes to reach Healthy/Synced)
- Gateway wait command succeeds (condition: Programmed)
- External Secrets objects present, ArgoCD secret exists in `argocd` namespace

## Visual walkthrough

![Platform Entry Points](../assets/diagrams/getting-started/verify-first-look.svg)

Application cards in ArgoCD show Sync and Health status; some OutOfSync states are normal during initial convergence. Left sidebar projects correspond to the fuses enabled in `config.toml`. Opening a card reveals the resource graph and metadata.

![ArgoCD — Applications list](../assets/images/verify/argocd_all_applications.png)

Inside an application (e.g., `observability-kube-prometheus-stack`) you can see the graph plus source, destination, and manual Refresh/Sync controls.

![ArgoCD — Application detail](../assets/images/verify/argocd_view_fluentbit-app.png)

Prefer the terminal? Use `k9s -A` and jump between `:pods`, `:deploy`, `:events` to watch live.

## Access endpoints

`task deploy` prints nip.io URLs based on your LAN IP:

![Gateway URLs printed by task deploy](../assets/images/verify/gateway-urls.png)

Patterns replace `<ip-dashed>` with your LAN IP: ArgoCD at `https://argocd.<ip-dashed>.nip.io`, Grafana at `https://grafana.<ip-dashed>.nip.io`, Vault at `https://vault.<ip-dashed>.nip.io`, Argo Workflows at `https://workflows.<ip-dashed>.nip.io`, SonarQube at `https://sonarqube.<ip-dashed>.nip.io`. They are reachable from other devices on your LAN if your OS firewall allows NodePorts `30080`/`30443` (or the values in `config.toml`).

## Login notes

- ArgoCD admin: `admin`
- Password: value from `config.toml` (`passwords.argocd_admin`, default `argo`), stored bcrypt in the ArgoCD secret.
- CLI from LAN: ArgoCD runs HTTP behind the Gateway, so use `--plaintext`:

```bash
argocd login argocd.<ip-dashed>.nip.io --username admin \
  --password <value-from-config.toml> --plaintext
```

## Certificates

TLS uses a local, self-signed root CA for `*.${DNS_SUFFIX}` (derived from your LAN IP). Browsers will warn on first visit; you can proceed or import the CA.

![Browser warning — self-signed TLS prompt](../assets/images/verify/browser-warning.png)

```bash
# Export the root CA from cert-manager (cert-manager/idp-demo-ca-secret)
kubectl -n cert-manager get secret idp-demo-ca-secret \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.tls\.crt}' | base64 -d > idp-demo-ca.crt
```

- macOS: Keychain Access → System → Certificates → import `idp-demo-ca.crt` → "Always Trust".
- Linux (Debian/Ubuntu): `sudo cp idp-demo-ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ && sudo update-ca-certificates`
- Windows: `certmgr.msc`, import into "Trusted Root Certification Authorities".

Certificates are issued automatically by cert-manager using that wildcard; the CA secret lives at `cert-manager/idp-demo-ca-secret`.

## Smoke checks

| Goal | Command | Expected result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ArgoCD apps listed and converging | `kubectl -n argocd get applications` | Apps present; Sync moves toward `Synced` over a few minutes |
| Grafana up with datasources | open `https://grafana.<ip>.nip.io` | UI loads; Prometheus/Loki datasources present |
| Trivy Operator running | `kubectl -n security get pods | rg --line-number "trivy"` | `trivy-operator` and `trivy-server` pods Ready |
| External Secrets working | `kubectl get externalsecrets,secretstores -A` | Objects present; ArgoCD secret exists (`kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-secret`) |
| Gateway programmed with certs | `kubectl -n kube-system get gateway idp-gateway -o yaml | rg --line-number "Programmed"` | Condition `Programmed` True; endpoints reachable over TLS |

## If something stalls

- Pods in `ImagePullBackOff`: check network access, free disk, then retry `task deploy`.
- Gateway not ready: free the ports defined in `config.toml` and re-run the wait command.
- Applications stuck OutOfSync: use ArgoCD UI or `argocd app sync <name>` after images are present.
