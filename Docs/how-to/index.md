# How-to Guides Overview

These guides turn architectural intent into actionable runbooks. Each guide
answers *how* to deploy, operate, and extend the blueprint.

## Tracks

- **Getting Started** – Prerequisites, quick start, and full deployment
  walkthroughs for local environments.
- **Operations** – Day-2 procedures (resource sizing, troubleshooting, upgrades,
  validation).
- **Contribution & Governance** – Collaboration norms, review checklists, and
  policy tagging workflows.

## Recommended Path

1. Confirm [Prerequisites](../getting-started/prerequisites.md).
2. Launch the platform with the [Quick Start](../getting-started/quickstart.md).
3. Follow the [Deployment Guide](../getting-started/deployment.md) for deeper
   context and tuning.
4. Bookmark the [Operations Checklist](../reference/resource-requirements.md) and
   [Troubleshooting Playbook](../reference/troubleshooting.md) for day-2 work.
