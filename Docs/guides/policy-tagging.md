# Kubernetes Labeling Standards for Policies

> **Note:** This guide has been consolidated into the complete labeling
> standards documentation.

All label and annotation standards – including PriorityClasses, External
Secrets refresh strategy, and ArgoCD sync‑wave conventions – now live in:

- [Kubernetes Labeling Standards](../reference/labels-standard.md)

For how labels are enforced and used at runtime, see:

- [Kyverno Policies](../components/policy/kyverno/index.md)
- [Architecture: Applications](../architecture/applications.md)
- [Scheduling, Priority, and Node Pools](../concepts/scheduling-nodepools.md)
