# IDP Blueprint Documentation

**IDP Blueprint** is an Internal Developer Platform reference architecture designed for modern cloud-native environments. This comprehensive platform engineering solution provides a complete stack including GitOps, observability, security, and policy enforcement, deployable for development, testing, and production environments. Also follows FinOps tagging practices to be prepared in case you add FinOps to the development cycle.

## Who Is This For?

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **Platform Engineers**

    ---

    Focus on the bootstrap layer, GitOps workflows, and operational guides under *How-to Guides → Operations*.

-   **Security & Policy Teams**

    ---

    Review Kyverno, Trivy, and governance references within *Platform Operations → Policy & Security*.

-   **Observability & SRE**

    ---

    Jump to *Platform Operations → Observability* for dashboards, alerts, and data flow diagrams.

-   **Application Teams**

    ---

    Use the quick-start and CI/CD sections to understand how workloads onboard to the platform.

## Platform Capabilities

!!! abstract "Production-Ready Platform Engineering"
    Complete platform engineering stack suitable for development, staging, and production environments. Designed for:

    - **Enterprise Architecture** - Evaluate cloud-native technologies in realistic deployment scenarios
    - **Infrastructure Prototyping** - Validate infrastructure changes before production rollout
    - **Team Enablement** - Platform engineering training and knowledge transfer
    - **Policy Validation** - Test and validate policies, workflows, and configurations

!!! example "Automated Deployment"
    ```bash
    task deploy
    ```
    Fully automated deployment orchestration including cluster provisioning, component installation, GitOps synchronization, and validation.

!!! info "Resource Requirements"
    Optimized resource allocation for various deployment scenarios:

    - **Minimum Configuration**: 4 CPU cores, 8GB RAM
    - **Recommended Configuration**: 6 CPU cores, 12GB RAM
    - **Storage Requirements**: ~20GB persistent storage
